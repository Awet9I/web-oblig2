      <h3>discuss the main challenges you had when implementing the page with regards to its responsive nature</h3>
      <p>The main challenge regards to the responsive nature of the page was to understand the media attribute inside the picture tag. Also we have to use two images of different widths according to screen size.</p>
      <h3>explain why you have used "&lt;picture&gt;" or "&lt;img&gt;"+srcset attribute"</h3>
      <p>I have used them because the &lt;picture&gt; tag provides more flexibility in specifying image resources.</p>
      <p>The most common use of the &lt;picture&gt; element will be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having one image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.</p>
      <p>The &lt;picture&gt; element contains two tags: one or more &lt;source&gt; tags and one &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>
